# Modeled Computer Vision Model

## Overview
This repository contains a pre-trained computer vision model saved in the PyTorch format (`modeled_computer_vision_model_2.pth`). The model has been trained to perform [specific task, e.g., image classification, object detection, etc.], achieving high accuracy and efficiency.

## File Description
- **modeled_computer_vision_model_2.pth**: The PyTorch model file containing the pre-trained weights and architecture.

## Requirements
To use this model, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.6 or later
- PyTorch 1.7.0 or later
- torchvision 0.8.0 or later (if using pre-trained models from torchvision)

You can install the necessary packages using:
```sh
pip install torch torchvision
```

## Usage
Here's how you can load and use the model in your Python code:

### Loading the Model
```python
import torch

# Specify the path to the model file
model_path = 'path/to/modeled_computer_vision_model_2.pth'

# Load the model
model = torch.load(model_path)
model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode
```

### Making Predictions
Assuming the model is for image classification, you can make predictions as follows:

```python
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image

# Define the image transformations
preprocess = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

# Load and preprocess the image
img = Image.open('path/to/image.jpg')
img_t = preprocess(img)
batch_t = torch.unsqueeze(img_t, 0)

# Make the prediction
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(batch_t)
    _, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)

# Print the predicted class
print(f'Predicted class: {predicted.item()}')
```

## Training
If you wish to retrain or fine-tune the model, refer to the following example:

```python
# Assuming you have a dataset and a DataLoader
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Replace with your dataset and DataLoader
train_loader = DataLoader(...)

# Define your loss function and optimizer
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for images, labels in train_loader:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        
        # Backward and optimize
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```
